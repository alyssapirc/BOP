		 	ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AND EDUCATION PROJECT aimed at restoring one billion live oysters to New York Harbor and engaging hundreds of thousands of school children through restoration based STEM education programs.  Students at New York Harbor School have been growing and restoring oysters in New York Harbor for the last six years.They have learned to SCUBA dive safely, raise oyster larvae, operate and maintain vessels, build and operate commercial-scaled oyster nurseries, design underwater monitoring equipment and conduct long-term authentic research projects all in the murky, contaminated, fast moving waters of one of the busiest ports in the country.  Together and with the help of many partners these students have restored over eleven million oysters. Thirty-six public schools have partnered with the project to provide authentic, place-based science and math lessons through the lens of oyster restoration.  Each year, thousands of students participate in these learning opportunities.</p>
		
		<h1> Fun Facts </h1>
			
			<ul> 
				<li> Oysters are good for your garden </li>
				<li> Oysters have the ability to change their sex </li>
				<li> Eating four oysters a day gives you a complete daily supply of copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus and zinc </li>
				<li> Oysters are rich in vitamins A, C, D and B-12. B-12 is well-known to help people lose weight and sharpen their memory </li>
				<li>When oyster larvae (baby oysters) attach themselves to a hard material, like an oyster shell, they are called spat </li>
			</ul>

		<h1> What it does </h3>
			
			<p>The Oyster Reef Restoration project involves the placement of more than 30 million pounds of cultch, which is typically made up of fossilized shell, coral or other similar materials produced by living organisms designed to provide points of attachment for oysters - that will be distributed within the St. Lucie Estuary and the Northwest Fork of the Loxahatchee River. The purpose of the cultch is to provide habitat for oyster colonization. They support critical fisheries and protected resources, improve water quality and protect shorelines. Oysters are an indicator species, meaning that their presence in the water can be used to gather information on the overall health of the estuary. Within the last 50 years, the oyster coverage that was historically present in the two estuaries has declined by as much as 75 percent.
